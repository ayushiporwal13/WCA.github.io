			<h2>Western Casewriters Association</h2>
			<p>Welcome to the Western Casewriters Association (WCA). WCA is the Western regional
				association of business casewriters. Its purpose is to train, develop and
				support business case writing for research and pedagogical purposes. WCA
				organizes an annual conference for experienced and new case-writers and
				academics using cases for classroom teaching. Please see Call for Cases tab on
				the menu for this year's conference, held in association with the annual meeting
				of the <a href="https://www.wamonline.org" target="_blank">Western Academy of Management (WAM).</a></p>
			<h2>Announcement</h2>
			<p> <a href="http://www.westerncasewriters.org/"> Western Casewriters Association (WCA)</a>
				and the <a href="http://www.jcri.org/"> Journal of Case Research and Inquiry (JCRI) </a> 
				invite educators, practitioners, and students to submit consulting cases for the 
				2025 "Making Your Consulting Case" competition.  The outstanding consulting cases will be invited for 
				submission to a special issue of JCR with Consulting cases. For more information and important dates, 
				<a href="https://be-edge.com/making-your-consulting-case-mycc-2026-competition/"> click here.</a></p>
			<h2>The Conference</h2>
			<p>The Western Casewriters Association annual conference is a unique opportunity to
				engage with other case-writers in a small group format to exchange feedback and
				polish-up your case, learn about using cases in the classroom, get a
				peer-reviewed conference on your vita and enjoy the presentations from leading
				case authors and case educators.</p>
			<p>It is an excellent professional development opportunity because it is a
				"developmental" conference designed to provide feedback from experienced case
				researchers in order to move the projects toward eventual publication in a
				top-level journal such as the Case Research Journal.</p>
			<p>The format is round-table discussions. You will be grouped with three or four
				other people who have written cases and will spend time with an experienced
				facilitator providing feedback on each others' cases. The feedback, although
				rigorous, is friendly. Or, you may attend the conference just to learn more
				about case-research and see presentations on how to teach with cases.</p>

                        Proceedings</span></a></li>
			
			<h2>Next Year’s Conference Date and Hotel Location: </h2>
			<p>March 12 2026</p>
			<p>Santa Fe, New Mexico</p>
			<p>Early Submission deadline: October 24, 2025 </p>
			<p>Submission deadline: January 11, 2026 </p>
			<h2>Reasons to Attend</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>To improve your case. Round table discussions provide an opportunity for
					feedback that otherwise would be difficult to obtain.</li>
				<li>To hone and refine your case research, writing, and teaching skills. By
					participating in a serious, constructive debate over cases, discussants will
					gain a variety of valuable insights that will assist in the development of
					the case presented and cases to be written in the future.</li>
				<li>To obtain assistance in making your cases publishable. A high percentage of
					WCA cases are published in one form or another every year.</li>
				<li>You will meet a lot of terrific people—dedicated case researchers, writers,
					and teachers to whom you can turn for friendship and assistance for years to
					come.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Who Should Attend</h2>
			<p>Academic researchers looking for a peer-reviewed platform to develop their
				research stream. If accepted, this will count as a peer-reviewed conference on
				your vita.</p>
